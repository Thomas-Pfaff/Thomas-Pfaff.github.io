**Paper:** Estimating the ‘Missing’ Houses of Silchester

**Authors:** Scott Ortman and John Hanson

**Date:** November 24, 2023

**Link:** [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/britannia/article/estimating-the-missing-houses-of-silchester/C0B137A161BB338EC31D4ACBC9F4DCDE][id]

##### Notes

The associated data allows one to recreate Fig 3 (x= lnSiteArea, y=lnNumProp both of which are already in the data set) copied below, in the paper showing that Silchester is an outlier. In the paper the regression line, 95% confidence interval, and 95% prediction interval are created without including Silchester.

##### Uses

- **Graphing:** Recreate the graph
- **Transform Data:**  Create the scatter plot with and with the ln() transformation of the data.
- **Statistics:** Linear regression, 95% confidence interval, 95% prediction interval
